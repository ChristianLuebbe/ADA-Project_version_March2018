# Applied Data Analysis Project by Sten Elling and Christian Luebbe

The analysis below was carried by us as the project components of the Applied Data Analysis course at the EPFL in 2017.

Our project analyses the movement of people into, around and out of the City of Zurich. All data was taken from the Zurich Open Data project. The data contains the year and start/destination district of a move as well as the features age, gender and marital status. We analyse the data and city and district level by looking at the overall population as well as specific subsets of features. The time series are visualised graphically and spatial distribution (e.g. comparisons between districts) are visualised using maps and widgets. In order to use the latter two the notebook has to be downloaded and executed. 

In the second part of the project we simulate the moving patter of individuals with different feature values. Our simulation takes into account the changing circumstances of these individuals due to marriage or building a family.
By running the simulations 1000 times we can give an estimate of the chance that the person lives in a particular district or outside Zurich later on. We compare these resulting distributions for two different scenarios.
